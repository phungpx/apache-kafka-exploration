# Broker

- A kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers (servers).
- Each broker is identified with its ID (integer).
- Each broker contains certain topic partitions.
- After connecting to any broker (called a bootstrap broker), you will be connected to the entire cluster (Kafka clients have smart mechanics for that).
